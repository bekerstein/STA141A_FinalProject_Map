# STA141A_FinalProject_Map

As a final step to visualizing the relationships between food insecurity and all of its factors, 
we created a map visualization with shapefile. This map depicts a blue-toned gradient to exemplify 
food insecurity, unemployment, and disability rates as well as median income in dollars projected 
onto California county limits. The red counties contain incomplete or no data from our datasets. As we iterate 
through the interactive layers, we can see that the map showed a potentially negative relationship
between food insecurity and income, and positive relationships between food insecurity and 
unemployment status and disability. Because we are presenting this report in a pdf format, we were 
unable to embed the HTML required to make this map interactive, however, we provide this code for 
interested parties in email format, separate from this report. The methodology used to produce this 
map can be seen here in the R Appendix.
